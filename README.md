# SuperRobos App

## Description

This App is built in React and TypeScript using Robohash API.I am a big fan of DC and Marvel Superheroes. Hence,i built this App displaying Superheroes generated by adding Superheroes name at the end of Robohash url.For example,https://robohash.org/Thor I built this App to practice ReactJS concepts by following Andrei's UDEMY tutorial.
